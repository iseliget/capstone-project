- **Number of principal components to keep**

There are two possible ways to do this. The first way is that, for each iteration, choose k such that the top-k principal components explain the 80% of the variance. This is more of a hand-waving way.Another more sophisticated way is to use Marcenko-Pastur distribution. For each iteration, we use Marcenko-Pastur distribution to determine the number of principal components we want to keep. This might turn into a small project by itself.
